6/25/05	6/26/05	done	if you load audio files before accessing help for the first time, help file is not found, because loading audio changes current folder; append help file name to app path and retry	1.0.83
3/13/05	3/19/05	done	if undo levels is set to zero, closing a modified document doesn't display a save prompt; in undo manager, NotifyEdit must bump m_Edits regardless of number of undo levels	1.0.83
2/27/05	2/27/05	done	in multi-auto dialog, adjusting position during play sets selected sliders to zero; side effect of adding variable waveforms, OnNewPos must use m_Info.m_Pos instead of GetNormPos	1.0.82
2/24/05	2/25/05	done	starting an auto-trigger turns off audio looping; potentially harmful, so make side effect optional	1.0.82

3/8/04	2/24/05	done	in auto-trigger dialog, pressing play forces audio looping off; multi-auto dialog should do the same	1.0.82
2/7/05	2/7/05	done	header sort generates spurious column width undo notifications; header's OnItemChanging should resize column only if width has actually changed	1.0.81

12/30/03	1/21/05	done	add support for HTML help	1.0.78
1/19/05	1/20/05	done	if saving doc causes doc title to change, doc titles in dialog bars aren't updated; captions of volume, snapshot, tempo, and M/S bars are one case, crossfader source list boxes are another	1.0.78

1/5/05	1/6/05	done	after audio play, and in other cases, multi-trigger dlg doesn't show audio position correctly; change auto trigger ctrl so that m_Pos is always audio position, except in get/set info	1.0.75
1/5/05	1/6/05	done	if a stopped track is rewound using channel's stop button, undo notification isn't sent; OnStop's duplicate notification test must account for rewind side effect	1.0.75
1/5/05	1/6/05	done	if a stopped track has its position moved away from start point, when doc is reopened, thumb and audio position don't agree; SetInfo is rewinding audio, use SetTransportAndPos	1.0.75
1/3/05	1/5/05	done	if non-repeat auto slider is played from pause, manually repositioned at start, and played from pause again, second time it doesn't move; in slider's OnTransport, use AtStart/AtEnd	1.0.75

11/1/03	12/30/04	done	with many docs open, app saturates CPU, because timer messages are triggering idle processing; override IsIdleMessage to exclude timer and other frequently repeated messages	1.0.73
12/29/04	12/29/04	done	undo auto edit restores the auto state using SetInfo, which doesn't call OnNewPos or OnSelection, so audio properties don't get updated; use SetInfoNotify instead	1.0.73
12/29/04	12/29/04	done	if you drag/move slider selection, and while holding down right button, move cursor outside slider and left-click, drag/move state sticks; OnLButtonDown must end select slider's modal state	1.0.73
12/29/04	12/29/04	done	if audio is playing, no previous loop exists, and a loop is created using a single click to the left of slider thumb, audio position can escape from loop; fudge compare by a slider increment	1.0.73

10/27/04	12/29/04	done	in auto slider, Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End should move selection, not thumb	1.0.73
12/26/04	12/27/04	done	multi edit auto dlg's selection edit boxes blank when selection is very short; in CSelectSliderCtrl, SetNormSelection must test its args for -1 instead of equality	1.0.73
12/24/04	12/26/04	done	make about box URL a hyperlink	1.0.73
10/1/04	12/24/04	done	change registry key	1.0.73

11/8/04	11/8/04	done	since 1.0.66, middle click in auto slider isn't activating channel; CDialogEx used to have a virtual OnNcActivate handler, lost during child dialog removal, add it to CAutoDlg instead	1.0.67
11/7/04	11/8/04	done	channel, derived dialog bars, and color status bar don't display MFC members in class wizard; derived name must contain an MFC base name or a recognized abbreviation, e.g. Dialog, Dlg	1.0.67

10/3/04	10/3/04	done	if app starts with tool tips disabled, main frame's control bars show them anyway, because restoring bar state magically enables tool tips for all the bars; tool tip state must be reapplied	1.0.65
10/3/04	10/3/04	done	if app state can't be restored (e.g. on first run), main frame's bars don't dock all on same row	1.0.65
10/2/04	10/2/04	done	bar captions are a mess; add origin shift to resizer, and make it a member of dialog bar base	1.0.65

10/1/04	10/1/04	done	if control bar is docked vertically, header control gets out of sync with view; allow horz dock only	1.0.65
10/1/04	10/1/04	done	if bars are on docked at top of frame in two rows, and one is dragged and redocked at bottom, header doesn't paint; CChildFrame::RecalcLayout must resize header *after* calling base class	1.0.65

11/30/03	12/2/03	done	during play, creating pos loop ahead of current pos causes jump to unexpected pos; also during play, left-clicking on pos track outside of loop area causes jump, both related to 1 sec problem	1.0.19
11/30/03	11/30/03	done	resizing with show window contents while dragging causes flickerama, major battle	1.0.16
11/30/03	11/30/03	done	flicker fix causes set channels to leave all ctrls undrawn (except pos!) if new channels are over cform bg; new does it too except file button gets drawn, total bitch	1.0.17
11/30/03	11/30/03	done	flicker fix causes selection to not paint number static boxes, must invalidate in chan select	1.0.18

3/24/05		hold	make CFormListView's resizable columns and header optional, to allow non-linear forms	
3/19/05		hold	waveform preview with time/ amplitude zoom, horz scroll bar, and selection; uncompr audio only	
2/1/05		hold	replace for channel titles? auto-hiding of file extension might be more useful	
2/1/05		hold	master mixer with mute/solo, volume and snapshot list for each open doc; reuse form list view	
1/29/05		hold	for pitch sliders, Page Up/Down keys should move thumb in semitones	
1/28/05		hold	auto time slider should support hundredths of a second, but then minutes button is misleading	
1/28/05		hold	when time slider's unit is seconds, spin delta is .01 seconds, but .05 is max timing resolution with 20Hz clock; slows stepping needlessly, delta could be .05 in this case	
1/14/05		hold	need secondary sort; could be modified header click, or a primary sort control	
11/9/04		hold	solve sync loss problem by adding sync mode to auto dlg; when set, auto pos is a modulus of a master clock instead of a unique state, and slider thumb is locked during automation	
10/30/04		hold	multi auto dialogs should be modeless; complicates undo and selection logic	
9/24/04		hold	showing a dialog bar doesn't give it focus; could be a feature, not sure	
5/7/04		hold	in multi auto dialogs, slider should have a datatip just like channel sliders; audio position is a problem because it's displayed in seconds and loops may have different lengths	
5/7/04		hold	need way to temporarily override mute/solo fading; control key?	
4/19/04		hold	add grouping with color-coded name buttons; channel number header should sort by group?	
3/12/04		hold	undo insignificant edits not fully implemented; would increase size of undo state	
3/12/04		hold	arrow keys should move current channel? can't use main accelerator, it breaks auto slider arrows	
2/18/04		hold	auto trigger slider should indicate auto pos; how to do without excessive overhead?	
1/17/04		hold	audio filename display options: suppress extension, remove leading digits	
1/9/04		hold	auto-scrubbing: automation that moves the audio selection instead of moving the thumb, but then how do you specify the automation range?	
1/1/04		hold	recording would be nice; use river past audio capture for now	
12/30/03		hold	presets and/or assignable macro keys to trigger fade in/out for several tracks at once (toshi)	
12/30/03		hold	context-sensitive help would be nice	
12/20/03		hold	alternate (faster) way to create automation loops; effect dialog with rate, width, bias controls?	
11/1/03		hold	dragging channels between documents; requires OLE

2/17/05		punt	if search string isn't found, closing message box should set focus to find dialog's edit control	
2/15/05		punt	if large fonts are enabled, auto-slider height is off by just a hair, so that tips of selection range arrows are visible at bottom of slider, but only when slider doesn't have focus	
2/15/05		punt	if large fonts are enabled, and a slider has selection range and bottom-pointing thumb, bottom edge of slider channel is visible through thumb; windows bug, must custom draw entire thumb	
1/17/05		punt	audio play crashes w2k on Gateway GP6-400; sound card driver issue? audiere bug?

10/2/04		punt	if a control bar is floating, tooltips of nearby channels are partially hidden or don't erase entirely	
9/30/04		punt	mixer should derive from scroll view, not form view, but drawing background flicker-free is hard	
9/26/04		punt	title shifts slightly to the right during popup edit (amount varies with font); handle paint?	
7/6/04		punt	raising tempo and lowering it again causes auto-trigger loops to get slightly out of sync	
7/4/04		punt	when a looping auto slider is resynced, undo doesn't restore original sync; problem occurs with all auto sliders, not only position, and not only with left-click, but also multi-edit, cut/paste, etc.	
6/26/04		punt	if position slider has a selection, for short samples, tool tip reports incorrect position when thumb is outside of selection, or near end of channel; audiere bug?	
3/10/04		punt	in multi auto dlg, if auto triggers are switched to non-repeat and stop by themselves, indicators on position slider thumbs sometimes become inaccurate; only happens with very short loops

3/7/04		punt	during undo, focus and active channel are always one step behind their correct position	
2/7/04		punt	on Dell laptop, loading audio by dragging files from Windows explorer can cause audio artifacts, e.g. clicking, esp. if many tracks are playing; roll your own modeless file browser?

1/1/04		punt	sometimes the focused channel isn't the same as the current channel	
1/1/04		punt	holding down close or minimize button in an automation dialog blocks message loop, causing automation to freeze; clicking on title bar also blocks but it recovers after a second or so	
12/8/03		punt	on Dell desktop, clicking pitch can cause volume to jump; another pitch-related Audiere bug?	
12/5/03		punt	volume controls leak slightly when all the way down, worse with master volume, no idea why	
12/2/03		punt	audio position correction fails when entering a loop for the first time; Audiere delay, no solution	
11/1/03		punt	restarting paused audio causes a nasty glitch in output; audiere bug, workaround is stop mutes volume and waits 50ms for stream to flush	
11/1/03		punt	on Dell desktop, moving pitch slider doesn't always change the pitch, especially near slider's endpoints; CAudio::SetPitch receives the message, but doesn't seem to hold it, Audiere bug?
