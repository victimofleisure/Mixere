<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Mixere is a free, open-source application for mixing audio files.  It runs on Windows NT/2000/XP, and supports WAV, AIFF, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Flac, and Mod audio files.

<p>Mixere is optimized for live performance, and especially for creating live sound collage.  Conceptually, it’s like a rack full of CD players connected to an automated mixer.  Mixere's features include dynamic looping of audio, auto-triggering of audio, fully automated sliders, "soft" (gradual) mute/solo operations, crossfading between documents, and unlimited undo.

<p>A Mixere document consists of a number of tracks, each containing a single audio file.  Any number of tracks can play simultaneously, subject only to the limits of Windows and sound card performance.  Audio is streamed directly from disk, so there's no limit on audio file size, and no waiting for audio to be loaded into memory.

<p>Mixere's interface is similar to a spreadsheet.  The rows are tracks, and the columns are properties which can be adjusted for each track: name, transport (play/pause/stop/loop), mute/solo, volume, pan, pitch (+/- one octave), and audio position.

<p>Mixere is licensed under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.html">GPL</a>, and uses an open-source audio library called <a href="http://audiere.sourceforge.net">Audiere</a>.  

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>Jul 6, 2007 - Mixere 1.1.00 released; position control now WORKS for MP3 files</h3>

<p>In previous versions, the position slider was not supported for MP3 files. This is fixed; the position slider moves while an MP3 is playing, and it's possible to seek within an MP3 by moving the position slider. This fix results from relinking Mixere to the latest version of Audiere (1.9.4.0), which may solve other issues too; for details, see <a href="http://audiere.sourceforge.net/">Audiere</a>.

<h3>Jun 26, 2005 - Mixere 1.0.83 released</h3> 

<p>This release contains bug fixes only. One of the bugs makes help inaccessible, so new users in particular should download this release, rather than 1.0.82. 
 
<p>The changes are as follows:
<ol>
<li>If you load audio files before accessing help for the first time, the help file is not found; fixed. 
<li>If undo levels is set to zero, closing a modified document doesn't display a save prompt; fixed. 
</ol>

<h3>Mar 1, 2005 - Mixere 1.0.82 released</h3> 

<p>Mixere is finally available for <a href="download.html">download</a>.  It's been a long time coming: development began in late October 2003, in Barcelona.

<h3>Dec 23, 2004</h3>

<p>Mixere will be released soon, watch this space
