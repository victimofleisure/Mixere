<h1>Features</h1>

<dl>
<dt><b>Automation sliders</b>
<dd>All sliders can be automated, individually or in groups.  Automation in this context means programming a slider thumb to move from one point to another within a given time interval.  Times can range from .01 seconds to 100 hours.  Automations can be one-shots or loops; loops can be used to create auto-panning, vibrato, and tremolo effects.
<dt><b>Variable automation waveforms</b>
<dd>Each automation has its own waveform setting.  The available waveforms are triangle, ramp up, ramp down, square, and random.
<dt><b>Audio looping</b>
<dd>Audio files can be played as one-shots or loops.  Any portion of an audio file can be looped, and a loop’s end points can be edited dynamically while the audio is playing.  The audio position can be also changed dynamically for “scratching” effects.
<dt><b>Clipboard support</b>
<dd>The standard Windows editing keys are fully supported for copying or moving tracks within a document, or between documents, via the Windows clipboard.
<dt><b>Unlimited undo</b>
<dd>Unlimited undo/redo is supported for all operations.
<dt><b>Dragging/sorting tracks</b>
<dd>Single or multiple tracks can be repositioned within a document using drag-and-drop, without interruption of audio.  Tracks can also be sorted by name or control value, by clicking on a column header.
<dt><b>Loading multiple audio files</b>
<dd>Any number of audio files can be inserted into a document at once, using either the standard file open dialog, or drag-and-drop from Windows Explorer.
<dt><b>Auto-trigger</b>
<dd>A track can be programmed to trigger its audio repeatedly, at a specific interval, regardless of the audio length.
<dt><b>Multi-track operations</b>
<dd>Multiple tracks can easily be played, paused, stopped, muted, or soloed simultaneously.  Slider automation can also be programmed in multiple tracks simultaneously.
<dt><b>“Soft” mute/solo</b>
<dd>A mute/solo operation can be made gradual rather than immediate; this unusual feature is very useful for live mixing.
<dt><b>Snapshots</b>
<dd>A document's state can be captured in a "snapshot", which can be restored at any time.  Any number of snapshots can be created, and they can have shortcut keys assigned to them.
