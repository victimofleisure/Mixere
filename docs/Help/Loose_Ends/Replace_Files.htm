<h3>Replace Files</h3>

<p>If "Open Dialog" is selected in the <a href="../Loose_Ends/Missing_Files.htm">Missing Files</a> dialog, the Replace Files dialog is displayed.  It includes a two-column list, containing one line for each missing file.  The file's name is shown in the Filename column, and its status ("Missing" or "Replaced") is shown in the Status column.  The Replace Files dialog gives you the following options:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<colgroup>
<col valign=top>
<col valign=top>
</colgroup>
<tr>
<td>Browse</td><td>Allows broken links to be repaired individually.  This is useful if a file has been renamed rather than moved.  To repair a link, select it in the list (left-click its name), and press Browse.  A file dialog is displayed.  Locate the file, select it, and press Open.  The file's status is updated from Missing to Replaced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Search Folder</td><td>Allows you to search for missing files in a specific folder.  The search is recursive, i.e. subfolders of the specified folder are also searched.  Use this option when you know where the missing files are, even approximately.  Press the button, and a folder dialog is displayed.  Locate the folder where you want to start the search, select it, and press OK to begin searching.  Found files will have their statuses updated from Missing to Replaced.  The search can be repeated in different folders, until all the missing files have been found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Search All</td><td>Searches for missing files in ALL folders of ALL hard disks.  This can take a long time, so you should only do this if you have no idea where the missing files are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OK</td><td>Ends the dialog and opens the document.  Any tracks that still have missing files will be blank; see the warning below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cancel</td><td>Ends the dialog and cancels opening the document.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>WARNING: If files are still missing when you press "OK", the document opens, but tracks that are missing files will be blank.  If you save the document in this situation, the damaged tracks will be <b>permanently deleted</b>.  To avoid doing this accidentally, save the document under a new name (using <em>File/Save As</em>) before proceeding.
