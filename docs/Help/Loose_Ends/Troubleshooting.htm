<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>You'll need a WAV file (NOT an MP3) to run the following test.  If you don't have one handy, you can usually find one in C:\WINNT\Media.

<ol>
<li>Run Mixere, so that you start with an empty document.
<li>Load the WAV file into a track: choose <em>Load Audio</em> from the File menu, locate the WAV file, left-click it, and press Open.
<li>Turn up the track's volume (move the volume slider to the right).
<li>Press the track's play button.
</ol>

<p>The track's position slider should start moving, and you should hear something.  If the WAV file is large, the position slider might move slowly, but if it never moves, something is wrong.  Maybe you have no sound card?  If the position slider moves, but you don't hear anything, here are some possible causes:

<ol>
<li>Maybe you don't have the track's volume up high enough.
<li>Maybe Mixere's master volume is down; to show the master volume slider, choose <em>Master Volume</em> from the View Menu.
<li>Maybe the Windows volume control is down, or muted.  It's usually found in the system tray, in the lower right corner of the screen.
<li>If your computer has external speakers, maybe they're not powered on, or they're unplugged, or their volume is down.
</ol>

<p>Try playing the same WAV file with Windows Media Player or WinAmp (double-click on it from Windows Explorer).  If that doesn't work either, the problem lies outside of Mixere.
