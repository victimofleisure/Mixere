<h3>Disk Usage</h3>

<p>Mixere streams audio directly from the audio files, instead of loading them into memory first.  This has two important advantages:

<ul>
<li>There's no limit on audio file size.
<li>Audio can be loaded very quickly.
</ul>

<p>A disadvantage of this method is that poor disk throughput will degrade Mixere's performance.  This can be an issue with older computers, especially laptops.  The best solution is to store audio files on a fast external hard drive, such as a Firewire drive.
