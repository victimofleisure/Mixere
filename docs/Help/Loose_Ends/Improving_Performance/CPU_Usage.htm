<h3>CPU Usage</h3>

<p>Mixere typically uses less than 5% of the CPU.  However, if you have many documents open, or if your documents contain many tracks, or many automations, CPU usage can increase substantially.  If CPU usage becomes a problem, here are some things to try:

<ul>
<li>Reduce the slider display smoothness, using <em>View/Options/Sliders</em>; for details, see <a href="../../Loose_Ends/Options.htm">Options</a>.
<li>Delete empty tracks from your documents.
<li>Open less documents at once.
<li>Uncheck the "Show window contents while dragging" system property (Settings/Control Panel/Display/Effects); for details, see <a href="../../Documents/Resizing_Columns.htm">Resizing Columns</a>.
</ul>
