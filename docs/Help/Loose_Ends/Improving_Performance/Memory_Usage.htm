<h3>Memory Usage</h3>

<p>Mixere typically uses somewhere between 5M and 15M of memory, which isn't much by today's standards.  However, if memory usage becomes a problem, here are some things to try:

<ul>
<li>Limit undo levels to 100 or less, using <em>View/Options/General</em>; for details, see <a href="../../Loose_Ends/Options.htm">Options</a>.
<li>Delete empty tracks from your documents.
<li>Open less documents at once.
</ul>
