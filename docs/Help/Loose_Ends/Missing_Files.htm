<h3>Missing Files</h3>

<p>A Mixere document does not contain audio files; it contains <em>links</em> to audio files.  This strategy has many advantages (e.g. Mixere documents are very compact), but it also has the disadvantage of allowing broken links.  Broken links occur when a document's audio files are moved or renamed.

<p>Broken links must be repaired before the document can be opened.  If you try to open a document with broken links, Mixere will display the Missing Files dialog, which gives you the following options:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<colgroup>
<col valign=top>
<col valign=top>
</colgroup>
<td>Search & Proceed</td><td>Searches ALL folders of ALL hard disks for the missing files.  This could take a long time, so only use this option when you have no idea where the missing files are.  If you know where they are, even approximately, it's much faster to use the "Open Dialog" option instead.  When the search is complete, the document is opened.  Any tracks whose files couldn't be found will be blank; see the warning below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proceed</td><td>Opens the document immediately, regardless of broken links.  Any tracks that link to missing files will be blank; see the warning below..
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Open Dialog</td><td>Displays the <a href="../Loose_Ends/Replace_Files.htm">Replace Files</a> dialog, which lists the names of the missing files, and allows you to browse for them individually, or search for them in specific folders.  If you want more control over the repair process, or if you know where the missing files are, even approximately, use this option instead of "Search & Proceed".
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cancel</td><td>Cancels opening the document.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>WARNING: In all of the above cases except "Cancel", it's possible to open the document with files still missing.  Tracks that are missing files will be blank.  If you save the document in this situation, the damaged tracks will be <b>permanently deleted</b>.  To avoid doing this accidentally, save the document under a new name (using <em>File/Save As</em>) before proceeding.
