<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Mixere is a standalone application, which means it doesn't have an installer.  To install Mixere, simply copy the following files into a folder somewhere on your PC's hard drive:

<p>audiere.dll
<br>Mixere.chm
<br>Mixere.exe

<p>That's all there is to it.  To run Mixere, double-click on Mixere.exe.

<p>To create a shortcut to Mixere, do the following: right-click on Mixere.exe, select "Create Shortcut", and drag the resulting shortcut onto the desktop, or wherever you want it to go.

<p>If the application displays the message "The dynamic link library audiere.dll could not be found in the specified path ...", it's probably because you forgot to copy audiere.dll into the same folder as Mixere.exe.
