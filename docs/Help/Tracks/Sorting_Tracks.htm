<h3>Sorting Tracks</h3>

<p>The column headers at the top of the document can be used to sort the tracks.  To sort a track by a given column, left-click the corresponding header button.  To reverse the sort, left-click the same button again.  For example, to put the tracks in ascending order by name, left-click the Name button.  To put the tracks in descending order by Name, left-click the Name button again.

<p>The leftmost column's header button (captioned '#') has a special meaning for sorting: it causes the tracks to appear in the order in which they were created.

<p>The column headers are also used for <a href="../Documents/Resizing_Columns.htm">resizing columns</a>.
