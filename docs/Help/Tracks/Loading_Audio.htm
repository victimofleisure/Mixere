<h3>Loading Audio</h3>

<p>A Mixere document consists of a number of tracks, each of which potentially contains an audio file.  A track must be <em>loaded</em> with an audio file before it can be used.  To load audio files, you can either:

<ul>
<li>Use the Load Audio dialog, or
<li>Drag audio files onto the document from Windows Explorer.
</ul>

<p>To display the Load Audio dialog box, do one of the following:

<ul>
<li>Choose <em>Load Audio</em> from the File menu, or press Ctrl+L.
<li>Choose <em>Load Audio</em> from the context menu; to display the context menu, right-click anywhere within the track EXCEPT over a slider.
<li>Press the Load Audio button on the toolbar.
</ul>

<p>Within the dialog box, select the audio file(s) you want to load, and press Open.  Multiple files can be selected using Ctrl+left-click.  To select a contiguous range of files, left-click the first file in the range, and then Shift+left-click the last file in the range.  You can use the file filter to restrict the types of files shown.

<p>When the context menu or Windows Explorer are used, audio is loaded at the cursor position.  Otherwise, audio is loaded before the current track (the one with the red track number).

<p>Audio can only be loaded into empty tracks.  If necessary, empty tracks are inserted automatically.

<p>Newly loaded tracks receive default attributes.  These defaults can be changed; see <a href="../Documents/Setting_Defaults.htm">Setting Defaults</a>.
