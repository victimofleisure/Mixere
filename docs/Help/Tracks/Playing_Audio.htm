<h3>Playing Audio</h3>

<p>Audio is played using the transport controls, which appear in the third column of a Mixere document, under the heading "Transport".  The controls consist of four buttons:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<colgroup>
<col valign=top>
<col valign=top>
</colgroup>
<tr>
<td>Play</td><td>Plays the audio from its current position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pause</td><td>Stops the audio without rewinding it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stop</td><td>Stops the audio and rewinds it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Loop</td><td>Turns loop mode on/off. Normally, a track plays until it reaches the end of the audio file, and then stops by itself.  However, in loop mode, the audio plays continuously.</td>
</tr>
