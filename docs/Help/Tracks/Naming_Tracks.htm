<h3>Naming Tracks</h3>

<p>When an audio file is loaded into a track, the track initially has the same name as the audio file.  However, you can change the track name to whatever you like.  To rename a track, double-click on its name.  The name becomes an edit box, allowing you to either edit the existing name, or type a new one.  To save the new name, press Enter, or left-click somewhere outside of the edit box.  To cancel the edit, press Esc.

<p>To revert to the track's original name (the audio filename), delete the entire name and press Enter.
