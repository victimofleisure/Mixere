<h3>Using the Clipboard</h3>

<p>Mixere supports the Windows clipboard in the usual way.  Tracks can be copied or cut to the clipboard, and then pasted to a different document, or to a different position in the same document.  To copy or cut multiple tracks at once, the tracks must be <a href="../Tracks/Selecting_Tracks.htm">selected</a> first.  A single track can be copied without selecting it.

<p>Tracks can be "cloned" by copying them and then pasting them repeatedly.  When a track is copied, all of its attributes are copied, including its audio position, mute/solo state, and automations.  Echo, chorus, and similar effects can be created by copying and pasting a playing track.

<p>Cut and paste can be used to move tracks around within a document, but because cutting a playing track interrupts its audio, you may prefer to use dragging instead.  For more information, see <a href="../Tracks/Moving_Tracks.htm">Moving Tracks</a>.
