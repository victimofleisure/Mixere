<h3>Volume</h3>

<p>Each document has its own volume slider, which controls the output level of all the tracks in that document.  The slider is contained in a document <a href="../Loose_Ends/Control_Bars.htm">control bar</a>.  To show or hide the control bar, choose <em>Volume</em> from the View menu, or press V.  Note that the volume slider supports <a href="../Automation/Automation_Sliders.htm">automation</a>, which means you can program a document to fade in or out by itself, while you do other tasks.

<p>A document's volume may also be affected by the <a href="../Documents/Crossfader.htm">Crossfader</a>, which fades back and forth between two documents, by the <a href="../Documents/Master_Volume.htm">Master Volume</a>, which controls the volume of the entire application, and by external factors, such as the Windows volume control.
