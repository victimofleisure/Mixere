<h3>Working with Multiple Tracks</h3>

<p>The leftmost column of each track contains the track number.  This column is also used for <em>selecting</em> tracks.  Left-click some track numbers (for best results, do this with tracks you've loaded audio into).  Notice that the tracks change color.  This means the tracks are selected.  Press Ctrl+C, and then Ctrl+V.  You've just copied and pasted (cloned) the tracks.

<p>When the tracks you want to select form a contiguous group, instead of left-clicking them one at a time, it's easier to use one of these methods:

<ol>
<li>Left-click the first track in the group, and then Shift+left-click the last track in the group.
<li>Left-click the first track in the group, but don't release the left mouse button yet; while holding down the button, drag the cursor over the rest of the tracks you want to select, and then release the button.
</ol>

<p>To clear the current selection, press Esc, or choose <em>Deselect</em> from the Edit menu.

<p>Notice that one of the track numbers is always a different color (red).  This indicates the current track.  When you modify a track (e.g. by adjusting one of its sliders), it becomes the current track.  You can also make a track current without modifying anything, by left-clicking on its name.

<p>In general, Edit and Track menu commands operate on either the selected tracks, or if no tracks are selected, on the current track.
