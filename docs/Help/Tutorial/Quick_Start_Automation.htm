<h3>Quick Start Automation</h3>

<p>Automation in this context means telling a slider thumb to move from one point to another within a given time interval.

<p>There are two ways to automate slider motion: a simple "Quick Start" method, and a more complicated method, with more options.  The second method is discussed in the next topic, <a href="../Tutorial/Programming_Automation.htm">Programming Automation</a>.

<p>Here's an example of the "Quick Start" method.  While holding down the Alt key, left-click anywhere within the pitch slider, other than on its thumb.  The pitch slider begins moving by itself, towards the location you selected.  Notice that the indicator on the slider thumb changes from red to green, to show that an automation is in progress.

<p>With this method, various automation parameters, including how long the automation will take, default to the slider's current settings.  The next topic explains how to view and edit those settings.
