<h3>Creating an Audio Selection</h3>

<p>Right-click within the position slider, and while holding down the right mouse button, move the cursor.  A blue bar appears within the slider.  This bar is called a selection.  Notice that the audio now loops within this selection.  You can use this feature to quickly create a sample within a larger audio file.  To extend or trim the selection, right-click in the position slider <em>without</em> dragging, in other words, right-click and immediately release the right mouse button.  To remove the selection, right-click just outside of the position slider.
